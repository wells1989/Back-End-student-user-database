This project was my first solo attempt at creating a responsive RESTful API database using express and Postgres

I focused on 2 key areas:
1. linking the database to express.js via the /students routes, adding GET / POST / PU / UPDATE requests
2. Creating a users table along with some basic authentication on the /auth/login and /auth/register routes (due to time limitations I kept the username etc variables locally, but if I had more time I would have linked them to Postgres in a similar way to the /student routes.)
